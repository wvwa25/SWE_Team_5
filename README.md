# Team 5 - Intro to SWE Project

  Welcome to the Team 5 class project repository for SWE 3313, Introduction to Software Engineering.
  Our presentations, documentation, source code and artifacts will be located here and updated as the project continues.

  For our application, we are building an e-commerce website with C# and ASP.NET Core Blazor to sell magical Dungeons & Dragons items.
  We invite you to have a look at the many facets our or software engineering process as shown in the sections below. The related links will direct you to the details of our work.
  
  Thank you for viewing our work!

## Project Plan

  We began our application-building process by flushing out the general preliminary details of what we will be making and how we will be making it, as well as defining our team roles.
  Please visit the links below for more information about our team and our project plan.

**Meet our Team**
  - [Trey Morris](project/trey_morris-résumé.md)
  - [Vera Warren-Aliff](project/vera_warren_aliff-résumé.md)
  - [Alejandro Albarran](project/alejandro_albarran-résumé.md)
  - [Syl Fowler-Berken](project/syl_fowler_berken-résumé.md)

**Team Assignments**

- To distribute work efficiently for this project, we allocated our team of four into three different roles: technical lead, administrative lead, and developer. 

- Click [here](project/team-assignments.md) to view a breakdown of our team assignments.

**Technology Selection**

- To build our application, we will be coding in C# ASP.NET through Blazor Server. We will use a MongoDB database to store user and item attributes.

- Click [here](project/technology-selection.md) for a detailed explanation of what technologies and tools we are using and why.

**Gantt Chart**

**Video Presentation**

- All of our video presentations will be hosted on Vimeo. Please visit this [link](https://vimeo.com/877352593) to watch our project plan presentation.

## Requirements

**Requirements List**

To prepare for the design of our application, our team produced a detailed [list of requirements](project/requirements.md) in markdown to define the numerous functionalities and features we will incorporate into our product. Our requirements are defined as a sequential list of sprints, epics, and stories. Each story represents an action item we will be implementing. Our list is split into 2 versions, of which we will be implementing version 1.

**Use Case Diagram and Decision Table**

- Additionally, we produced a [Use Case Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/NP1DImCn48Rl-HN3takntoVfAY85GUcYzo4xrgMRPCaarbByxpQxhamypJp9C-_XtN907w9f5HyRsw570wY3yrKujmHu8dQ6L8VwY0U2LoRF5rMaMG1o_w2AiZQDxRdVrBVwkoYxhcqqXiRPYmA8J1gPeAYeVP_iwT1m80-brYxQC4JUtqZnoHrWPwTfFCVHc4dZphlJTQAjeIBq-WDsWGp_gdEfliJhTzgaiP36MqCd6BKwyvR_lUd3L-TyW0fROjXJWg9NLo3Tihu6sK-omVbp5hcMsgD76uO6Ko74exL9XQfKDKmcjwaW2JC9SmaB2KkbXkZnIj8yeqL6ounM6QqpsgWjsJgQzWS0) on PlantUML to show how users will interact with our application.
- We also created a [Decision Table](project/decision-table.md) in markdown to define which features which users will have access to.

**Video Presentation**

- Please visit these links above and watch our requirements presentation [here](https://vimeo.com/879068697?share=copy).

## User Interface Design
To begin our application design, we determined how the user interface will look and flow. Our deliverables for this phase were a UI prototype and a video presentation.

**UI Prototype**

- We created an interactive [mockup UI in Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/c216791) to demonstrate the features and appearance of each screen and how these screens will connect to each other. We went for something clean and familiar to users, but with enough creative flair to be interesting to look at. Syl created the D20 die artwork seen on the landing page/account creation page and got us started on a general layout. I did a little bit of prototyping in Blazor Server to provide an idea of how the actual application will look in practice, then each of us took charge of a section of the prototype and built multiple screens.

**Video Presentation**

- The video presentation demonstrating our high-fidelity UI prototype is located [here](https://vimeo.com/885065514).

## Technical Design
The technical aspects of our design were flushed out in this phase, in which we created several documents demonstrating different parts of the application's backend structure.

**Languages and Frameworks**

- The programming languages and frameworks we used for our application are listed [here](project/implementation.md), as well as an explanation of why we chose these technologies.

**Entity Relationship Diagram, Field Descriptions, and Example Data**

- Our Entity Relationship Diagram and field descriptions show what data is stored in our system, how it will be stored, where it will go, and what it may look like.
- Click [here](project/entity-relationship-diagram.md) to view our ER Diagram, entity field descriptions, and data examples.

**Data Storage Plan and Seed Data**

- We created a [breakdown](project/data-storage-plan.md) of how data will be stored and accessed in our database as well as what seed data will be in the database on startup.

**Coding Style Guide**

- As a basis for our coding style, we are using Google's C# coding guidelines. Our style guide is shown in detail [here](project/style-guide.md).

**Video Presentation**
