# Team 5 - Intro to SWE Project

  Welcome to the Team 5 class project repository for SWE 3313, Introduction to Software Engineering.
  Our presentations, documentation, source code and artifacts will be located here and updated as the project continues.

  For our application, we will build an e-commerce website using C# and ASP.NET Core to sell magical Dungeons & Dragons items.

  Please visit the links below for more information about our team and our project plan and thank you for looking at our work!

### Project Plan

**Meet our Team**
  - [Trey Morris](project/trey_morris-résumé.md)
  - [Vera Warren-Aliff](project/vera_warren_aliff-résumé.md)
  - [Alejandro Albarran](project/alejandro_albarran-résumé.md)
  - [Syl Fowler-Berken](project/syl_fowler_berken-résumé.md)

**Team Assignments**

To distribute work efficiently for this project, we allocated our team of four into three different roles: technical lead, administrative lead, and developer. 

* Click [here](project/team-assignments.md) to view a breakdown of our team assignments.

**Technology Selection**

To build our application, we will be coding in C# ASP.NET through Blazor Server. We will use a MongoDB database to store user and item attributes.

### Requirements
To prepare for the design of our application, our team produced a detailed [list of requirements](project/requirements.md) in markdown to define the numerous functionalities and features we will incorporate into our product. Our requirements are defined as a sequential list of sprints, epics, and stories. Each story represents an action item we will be implementing. Our list is split into 2 versions, of which we will be implementing version 1.

Additionally, we produced a [Use Case Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/NP1DImCn48Rl-HN3takntoVfAY85GUcYzo4xrgMRPCaarbByxpQxhamypJp9C-_XtN907w9f5HyRsw570wY3yrKujmHu8dQ6L8VwY0U2LoRF5rMaMG1o_w2AiZQDxRdVrBVwkoYxhcqqXiRPYmA8J1gPeAYeVP_iwT1m80-brYxQC4JUtqZnoHrWPwTfFCVHc4dZphlJTQAjeIBq-WDsWGp_gdEfliJhTzgaiP36MqCd6BKwyvR_lUd3L-TyW0fROjXJWg9NLo3Tihu6sK-omVbp5hcMsgD76uO6Ko74exL9XQfKDKmcjwaW2JC9SmaB2KkbXkZnIj8yeqL6ounM6QqpsgWjsJgQzWS0) on PlantUML to show how users will interact with our application and a [Decision Table](project/decision-table.md) in markdown to define which features certain users will have access to.

### User Interface Design
For the first part of the design phase, we created a [mockup UI in Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/c216791) to demonstrate the application's appearance and flow. We went for something clean and familiar to users, but with enough creative flair to be interesting to look at. Syl created the D20 die artwork seen on the landing page/account creation page and got us started on a general layout. I did a little bit of prototyping in Blazor Server to provide an idea of how the actual application will look in practice, then each of us took charge of a section of the prototype and built multiple screens.

The video presentation demonstrating our high-fidelity UI prototype is located [here](https://vimeo.com/user16597860).
