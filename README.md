### Requirements
To prepare for the design of our application, our team produced a detailed [list of requirements](project/requirements.md) to define the numerous functionalities and features we will incorporate into our product. Our requirements are defined as a sequential list of sprints, epics, and stories. Each story represents an action item we will be implementing. Our list is split into 2 versions, of which we will be implementing version 1. 

Additionally, we produced a [Use Case Diagram](project/use-case-diagram.md) to show how users will interact with our application and a [Decision Table](project/decision-table.md) to define which features certain users will have access to.
